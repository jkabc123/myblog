            "content": "Introduction . yield syntax was first introduced to Python in PEP 255. It was introduced to faciliate the concept of generator. In short, generator provides a kind of function which returns an immediate value to the caller, then it stops and its state is maintained so that it can be resumed later. . Then enhanced generator was proposed in PEP 342. It mainly introduced generator expression and send method. . Later on in PEP 380, syntax yield from was proposed to allow a generator to delegate parts of its operation to another generator. . These yield syntaxes and the programming techniques around them are so unqiue in Python, they become one of the trademarks magics Python produces and still facinate programmers till today. A better understanding of these techniques will not only make our code more clean and but also easy to understand and more efficient. . Example of yield . Now we have a look at a simple example to define a function countdown which counts down from the number max and produces the value. . def countdown(max): n=0 while n&lt;max: print(&quot;Before yield&quot;, n) yield n n+=1 print(&quot;After yield&quot;,n) . countdown(3) . &lt;generator object countdown at 0x0000021F5B214148&gt; . gen=_ . next(gen) . Before yield 0 . 0 . next(gen) . After yield 1 Before yield 1 . 1 . next(gen) . After yield 2 Before yield 2 . 2 . next(gen) . After yield 3 . StopIteration Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-17-6e72e47198db&gt; in &lt;module&gt; -&gt; 1 next(gen) StopIteration: . From the code above you can tell, once you have a yield statement inside countdown function, it becomes a function returns generator object. . You can call next on gen. It will run to yield and then stops there. . When you call next on gen again, it continues to run from the previous state to the next yield. . You continue to call next on gen a few times until it exits the loop. Because now it can&#39;t reach the yield statement, it produces a StopIteration Exception. . How things work .
